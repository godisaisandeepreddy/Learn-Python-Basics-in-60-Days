## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Loops?

Loops let us **repeat a block of code multiple times** instead of writing it again and again.

Python has two main loops:

- `for` loop ‚Üí iterates over a sequence (list, string, range, etc.)
    
- `while` loop ‚Üí repeats until a condition becomes false

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `for` Loop

### üîπ Basic Syntax

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code block
```

### üîπ Examples

```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Loop through a string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

# Loop with range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)   # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Range with start & step
for i in range(2, 10, 2):
    print(i)   # 2, 4, 6, 8
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `while` Loop

### üîπ Basic Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # code block
```

### üîπ Examples

```python
# Print numbers 1‚Äì5
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# Countdown
n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
print("Blast off!")
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with **infinite loops**:

```python
while True:
    print("Running forever... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)")
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Loop Control Statements

### üîπ `break` ‚Üí exit the loop immediately

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)   # stops at 4
```

---

### üîπ `continue` ‚Üí skip the current iteration

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)   # prints 0,1,3,4
```

---

### üîπ `else` with loops ‚Üí executes only if loop finishes without `break`

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished successfully")

# Example with break
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("This will not run because of break")
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Loops

Loop inside another loop.

```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Day 3 Exercises

1. Print numbers from **1 to 10** using both `for` and `while` loop.
    
2. Write a program to print the **multiplication table of 7**.
    
3. Use a loop to **reverse a string** (without slicing).
    
4. Write a program that asks for a number `n` and prints all numbers from `n` down to `1`.
    
5. Print a pattern using nested loops:
    
    ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ```
    
6. Use `break` to stop when the loop reaches number 7 in range(1, 20).
    
7. Use `continue` to skip printing odd numbers from 1 to 10.
    
8. Write a loop with `else` that confirms loop completed successfully.

‚úÖ By end of Day 3 ‚Üí You will master **for loops, while loops, break, continue, else on loops, and nested loops**.
